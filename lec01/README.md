# Lecture 1

In GitHub it is very handy to make a README.md in each directory because the contents of this file will be shown by default when selecting the directory.

The directory will typically contain other ancilliary files, such as images, data, script, Makefiles, etc.

Here is the course banner as an image:

A script in the directory:

* [analysis.sh](analysis.sh)

A Makefile in the directory:

* [Makefile](Makefile)

You can run the Makefile by typing `make` at the command line. This will execute the script.

```bash
make
```

will print

```

# Use the source, Luke!
