### Tips for creating a new repository

One of the first tasks that we ask is that every student learns to use git and GitHub. This is a critical skill that will be useful in your future career. 

Notable mistakes that students make when creating repositories:

1. *Giving the repository an overly long name* --> Keep the name short and to the point.
1. *Making separate repositories for each submission.*  --> You need  a single repository for all your submissions!
2. *Not having file extensions to file names!* --> Always have an extension to inform the reader, the visualizer, the text editor of how to show the text.
3. *Using spaces in filenames!* --> Spaces are trouble at the command line! Add minus or underscore to separate words. For example instead of calling the file cell `cyle counts.txt` name it as `cell-cycle-counts.txt` or `cell_cycle_counts.txt `
4. Place each submission into a separate directory. There will be many files by the end, so organize your files from the start.
