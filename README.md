### Tips for creating a new repository

One of the first tasks we require every student to complete is learning to use `git` and GitHub.

Mastering `git`, `markdown`, and understanding how scientific code is developed are critical skills that will benefit you throughout your career.

Common mistakes students make when creating repositories:

1. **Giving the repository an overly long name**  
   Keep the name short and concise.
   
2. **Creating separate repositories for each submission**  
   You only need one repository for all your submissions.

3. **Omitting file extensions from filenames**  
   Always include a file extension to help others (and tools) understand how to read or display the file.

4. **Using spaces in filenames**  
   Spaces can cause issues in command-line environments. Use hyphens or underscores to separate words. For example, instead of naming a file `cell counts.txt`, name it `cell-cycle-counts.txt` or `cell_cycle_counts.txt`.

5. **Not organizing submissions into separate directories**  
   As the project grows, managing files becomes difficult. Organize from the beginning by placing each submission in its own directory.
